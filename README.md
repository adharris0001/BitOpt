#Pitch & Description

Pitch

BitOpt is an application that optimizes your mining system based on hourly updated cryptocurrency values. This application takes a significant amount of computational work away from the miner and provides automated statistics to aid in achieving the miner’s profit gain.

Description

BitOpt will read the past monthly average value of the selected cryptocurrency, the updated value on the hour, and will calculate the deviation between both values. Using this deviation, your mining system’s compute capacity can be optimized to the suggested percentage.
